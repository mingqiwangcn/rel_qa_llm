You are given some passages and need to follow the instructions to extract a table from each passage.

Instructions:
1. Extract a table with 7 columns, "entity", "property name" and "property value", "minimun value", "maximum value", "unit of measurement" and "value category"
2. the entity must be a polymer
3. Set unit of measurement to be "N/A" if there is no unit.
4. Set property value to be "N/A" if it is not a number.
5. If a value is changed from val_1 to val_2, use the "exact" value category, and fill val_2 in "property value" column.
6. If value category is "exact", both "minimum value" and "maximum value" must be "n/a"
7. Follow the example passages and example answers to format numbers. 

Example Passages:
1. 1.25, 2.36, and 3.69 cm for length of A B C respectively.
2. 2.6 to 3.2 miles for distance of B, E, and G.
3. weight greater than 60 kg for the group.
4. The quantity of A is reduced from 3.2 to 1.6
5. The values for field size of ABC is updated from 1.2 to 5.6.

Example Answers:
entity | property name | property value | minimum value | maximum value | unit of measurement | value category 
A | length | 1.25 | n/a | n/a | cm | exact
B | length | 2.36 | n/a | n/a | cm | exact
C | length | 3.69 | n/a | n/a | cm | exact
B | distance | n/a | 2.6 | 3.2 | miles | between
E | distance | n/a | 2.6 | 3.2 | miles | between
G | distance | n/a | 2.6 | 3.2 | miles | between
group | weight | n/a | 60 | n/a | kg | minimum
A | quantity | 1.6 | n/a | n/a | n/a | exact
ABC | field size | 5.6 | n/a | n/a | exact
